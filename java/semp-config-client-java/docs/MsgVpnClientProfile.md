**tcpCongestionWindowSize** | **Integer** | The TCP initial congestion window size for clients belonging to this profile.   The initial congestion window size is used when starting up a TCP connection or recovery from idle (that is, no traffic). It is the number of segments TCP sends before waiting for an acknowledgement from the peer. Larger values of initial window allows a connection to come up to speed quickly. However, care must be taken for if this parameter&#39;s value is too high, it may cause congestion in the network. For further details on initial window, refer to RFC 2581. Changing this parameter changes all clients matching this profile, whether already connected or not.   Changing the initial window from its default of 2 results in non-compliance with RFC 2581. Contact Solace Support personnel before changing this parameter. The default value is &#x60;2&#x60;. |  [optional]
**tcpKeepaliveCount** | **Integer** | The number of keepalive probes TCP should send before dropping the connection. The default value is &#x60;5&#x60;. |  [optional]
**tcpKeepaliveIdleTime** | **Integer** | The time (in seconds) a connection needs to remain idle before TCP begins sending keepalive probes. The default value is &#x60;3&#x60;. |  [optional]
**tcpKeepaliveInterval** | **Integer** | The time between individual keepalive probes, when no response is received. The default value is &#x60;1&#x60;. |  [optional]
**tcpMaxSegmentSize** | **Integer** | The TCP maximum segment size for the clients belonging to this profile. The default value is &#x60;1460&#x60;. |  [optional]
**tcpMaxWindowSize** | **Integer** | The TCP maximum window size (in KB) for clients belonging to this profile. Changes are applied to all existing connections. The maximum window should be at least the bandwidth-delay product of the link between the TCP peers. If the maximum window is less than the bandwidth-delay product, then the TCP connection operates below its maximum potential throughput. If the maximum window is less than about twice the bandwidth-delay product, then occasional packet loss causes TCP connection to operate below its maximum potential throughput as it handles the missing ACKs and retransmissions. There are also problems with a maximum window that&#39;s too large. In the presence of a high offered load, TCP gradually increases its congestion window until either (a) the congestion window reaches the maximum window, or (b) packet loss occurs in the network. Initially, when the congestion window is small, the network&#39;s physical bandwidth-delay acts as a memory buffer for packets in flight. As the congestion window crosses the bandwidth-delay product, though, the buffering of in-flight packets moves to queues in various switches, routers, etc. in the network. As the congestion window continues to increase, some such queue in some equipment overflows, causing packet loss and TCP back-off. The default value is &#x60;256&#x60;. |  [optional]
